# Python-to-Pseudocode

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Put the file you want to convert into the same folder as it, and rename it to "file.py"
2. Add a "#F" comment to any lines in the code which have a function call that doesn't assign anything (so no =),
as the program cannot handle these convincingly
3. Run the converter file

"Happy coding.."
